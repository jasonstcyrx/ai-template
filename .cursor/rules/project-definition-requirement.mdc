# Project Definition Requirement Rule

## Core Rule: No Development Without Vision

**The AI is PROHIBITED from performing any development work until a comprehensive `docs/WHAT_WE_ARE_CREATING.md` document exists and is well-crafted.**

## Rule Enforcement

### Prohibited Activities Until Document Exists

- Writing any code
- Creating components, services, or APIs
- Setting up development environments
- Installing dependencies
- Creating database schemas
- Writing tests
- Generating documentation (except WHAT_WE_ARE_CREATING.md)

### Allowed Activities

- Helping craft the `docs/WHAT_WE_ARE_CREATING.md` document
- Asking clarifying questions about the business vision
- Providing guidance on B2B system best practices
- Suggesting market research approaches
- Offering competitive analysis insights

## Required Document Structure

The `docs/WHAT_WE_ARE_CREATING.md` must contain:

### 1. Executive Summary (Required)

- **Problem Statement**: What specific B2B problem are we solving?
- **Solution Overview**: How does our system solve this problem?
- **Value Proposition**: Why would businesses choose our solution?
- **Market Opportunity**: Size and scope of the target market

### 2. Business Model (Required)

- **Revenue Streams**: How does the system generate revenue?
- **Target Customers**: Specific B2B customer segments
- **Pricing Strategy**: How is the solution priced?
- **Sales Process**: How are customers acquired and onboarded?

### 3. Autonomous System Design (Required)

- **Automation Capabilities**: What processes run autonomously?
- **Decision-Making Logic**: How does the system make business decisions?
- **Self-Improvement Mechanisms**: How does the system learn and improve?
- **Human Oversight Requirements**: Where is human intervention needed?

### 4. Technical Architecture Overview (Required)

- **Core Components**: Main system modules and their purposes
- **Integration Points**: How the system connects with other B2B tools
- **Scalability Design**: How the system handles growth
- **Security Framework**: B2B security and compliance considerations

### 5. Competitive Advantage (Required)

- **Unique Differentiators**: What makes this solution unique?
- **Competitive Landscape**: Key competitors and how we differ
- **Barriers to Entry**: What protects our market position?
- **Innovation Pipeline**: Future enhancements and capabilities

### 6. Success Metrics (Required)

- **Business KPIs**: Revenue, customer acquisition, retention metrics
- **System Performance**: Automation efficiency, uptime, accuracy
- **Customer Success**: Usage metrics, satisfaction scores
- **Market Position**: Market share, competitive benchmarks

## Document Quality Standards

### Content Requirements

- **Specific and Actionable**: Avoid vague statements and generalizations
- **Market-Validated**: Include evidence of market need and demand
- **Technically Feasible**: Ensure proposed solutions are buildable
- **Financially Viable**: Include realistic financial projections
- **Competitively Differentiated**: Clear competitive advantages

### Writing Standards

- **Clear and Concise**: Professional B2B communication style
- **Data-Driven**: Include market research, customer feedback, financial projections
- **Visually Enhanced**: Include diagrams, flowcharts, or mockups where helpful
- **Stakeholder-Ready**: Suitable for investors, customers, and development teams

## Validation Process

### Document Must Pass These Checks

1. **Completeness**: All required sections are thoroughly addressed
2. **Clarity**: A B2B decision-maker could understand the value proposition
3. **Feasibility**: Technical and business model are realistic and achievable
4. **Differentiation**: Clear competitive advantages are articulated
5. **Measurability**: Success can be tracked through defined metrics

### AI Validation Questions

Before allowing development work, the AI must confirm:

- [ ] Does this describe a compelling B2B solution?
- [ ] Is the autonomous aspect clearly defined and valuable?
- [ ] Are the revenue streams realistic and sustainable?
- [ ] Is the technical approach feasible with current technology?
- [ ] Would this document convince a potential customer or investor?

## Exception Handling

### Document Iteration Process

- The AI may help iterate and improve the document
- Multiple drafts and refinements are encouraged
- Stakeholder feedback should be incorporated
- Market validation should inform revisions

### Bypassing the Rule

This rule can only be bypassed if:

1. The human explicitly states they want to proceed without the document
2. The AI warns about the risks of proceeding without clear vision
3. The human acknowledges and accepts these risks

## Benefits of Following This Rule

### Business Benefits

- **Clear Vision**: Everyone understands what we're building and why
- **Market Focus**: Ensures we're solving real B2B problems
- **Investment Readiness**: Document serves as foundation for funding discussions
- **Customer Alignment**: Clear value proposition for potential customers

### Development Benefits

- **Focused Development**: Code serves the business vision
- **Better Architecture**: Technical decisions align with business needs
- **Reduced Rework**: Less pivoting due to unclear requirements
- **Team Alignment**: Developers understand the business context

### Risk Mitigation

- **Market Risk**: Validates demand before building
- **Technical Risk**: Ensures feasibility before committing resources
- **Competitive Risk**: Identifies and addresses competitive threats
- **Financial Risk**: Validates business model before investment

## AI Assistance Framework

### How AI Should Help Create the Document

#### Discovery Questions to Ask

- "What specific B2B pain point does this system solve?"
- "Who exactly would pay for this solution and why?"
- "What makes this autonomous system valuable to businesses?"
- "How does this system improve upon existing solutions?"
- "What data or processes can be automated to create value?"

#### Guidance to Provide

- B2B market sizing and research techniques
- Competitive analysis frameworks
- Business model validation approaches
- Technical architecture best practices for B2B systems
- Autonomous system design patterns

#### Resources to Suggest

- Industry reports and market research
- Competitor analysis tools and techniques
- Customer interview frameworks
- Financial modeling templates
- Technical feasibility assessment methods

## Remember: Vision First, Code Second

**No amount of perfect code can compensate for building the wrong product. This rule ensures we build something the market actually wants and will pay for.**
