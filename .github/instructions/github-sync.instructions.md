# # GitHub Issue Sync Rules
# This file defines the rules for syncing GitHub issues with the custom ticketing system.
# ## Overview
# The project uses a custom ticketing system managed through npm scripts. Tickets are stored in the `tickets` directory.
# The `ticket:sync` command synchronizes GitHub issues with the local ticketing system.
# The `ticket:push` command pushes local tickets to GitHub as issues.
# ## Available Commands
# ### Sync GitHub Issues
# ```bash
# npm run ticket:sync
# ```
# This command fetches issues from GitHub and updates the local ticketing system.
# It will:
# - Create new tickets for issues that do not exist locally
# - Update existing tickets with changes from GitHub
# - Remove tickets that have been closed on GitHub
# - Log any errors or conflicts during the sync process
# ### Push Local Tickets to GitHub
# ```bash
# npm run ticket:push
# ```
# This command pushes local tickets to GitHub as issues.
# It will:
# - Create new issues for tickets that do not exist on GitHub
# - Update existing issues with changes from local tickets
# - Remove issues on GitHub that have been closed locally
# - Log any errors or conflicts during the push process
# ## Ticket File Format 
# Each ticket is stored as a Markdown file with the following structure:

# ```markdown

# id: TICKET-123
